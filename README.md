Systemd service for code-cli
============================

Run code-cli serve web or tunnel using systemd. This has been part of my [`devenv`](https://github.com/gbraad-devenv/) installs, [`code-serveweb-action`](https://github.com/gbraad-actions/code-serveweb-action), and [`code-tunnel-action`](https://github.com/gbraad-actions/code-tunnel-action) actions.
